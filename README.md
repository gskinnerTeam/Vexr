# MiniVec

This is a simple little 2D vector class I made to goof around with on Codepen. It is unoptimized and I'm not even 100% sure all the math for the vectors is correct. I would recommend that you do not use this in production code without writing some tests. No doubt a more complete vector library is available that has things like unit and performance tests. However, if you want to pick apart some vectors for a learning exercise this can serve as an example without any extra fluff. 

The movers and attractors (attractors are incomplete atm) come from a lecture series by Daniel Shiffman @ http://natureofcode.com/ which I highly recommend.
